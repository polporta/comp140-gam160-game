Game Proposal: Pol Porta

The game I have in mind would be a running type game, which would involve music, in the game you will have to complete the levels while completing the music.
The core mechanic of the game would be to avoid the obstacles to not interrupt the flow of the music; the levels will have three different obstacles, these obstacles will be cleared by jumping, sliding and punching; it will obviously be linked with the rhythm of the music, which will be focus on the compass of the drums.
Every time in the song the bass drum is used the player will need to slide to avoid the obstacle, whenever the snare drum is used in the song the player will have to jump and the last mechanic would be the crash cymbal (plate), whenever is used the player will have to punch through the obstacle.
The art style will be probably based on music sheets and notes, the difficulty of the game will increase depending on the song.
The game will be 3D with a third person point of view where the character will be animated, and if possible, I would add some customization to it.
In case of the player missing an obstacle the music will break, a progress bar will be on top of the screen, which will keep track of both the progress and the clarity of the song then a score will be displayed and if itâ€™s below average the player will have to re-play the song until accomplishing the minimum scored required. Some of the songs will be self-made and some others will be checked to see if they do not have copyright.
