Repository for Assignment 1 of COMP140-GAM160
Game Proposal: Pol Porta
## Core Mechanics
The game Is a running type game which would involve music, the main mechanic is that as you get close to the wall with a compass drawn in it that blocks your path, a pattern will be displayed in the screen and you must repeat it with the controller, that will destroy the door and with the correct timing will make the song clear.

The game will be seen from a First Person point of view and the pattern will be displayed in the center of the screen, the player wonâ€™t have any control over the character so it will move forward without stopping, if the character hits a wall it's game over and the player has to restart the game, the level will have a straight linear path with different combinations of notes, they will display different patterns depending on the compass of the partiture, the difficulty will increase when after a few walls the patterns will stop popping on the screen and the player will have to memorize the controllers.
The music will mostly be instrumental and the player will emit sounds when using the controller, this sounds will be a bass drum, snare drum, high tom-tom, medium tom-tom, high hat and the crash cymbal depending on the pattern that he/she will have to follow.
